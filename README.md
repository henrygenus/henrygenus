## PROGRESSION
In looking through my code, one may notice some specific idiosyncrasies and variable style choices. As it is too much code for me to go back and stylize more choices, I believe it prudent to list the order I took the classes in, so that readers can see relevance and development. What follows is the order I took classes in, with the logical '&' to represent concurrency.
